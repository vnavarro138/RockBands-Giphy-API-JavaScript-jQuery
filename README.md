# RockBands-Giphy-API-JavaScript-jQuery

This website makes use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. User is prompted to enter their favorite band's name, but in reality this website is not limited to only looking up band APIs, it will work for any topic. This website calls the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

To check out some cool rock bands' gifs for yourself, type in a band name and submit, a button containing the information you entered will render on the page, you can now click it and the code should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

For safety reasons, under every gif, the page will display its rating (PG, G, so on).
